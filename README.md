A small app allowing prospective employers to add themselves to my [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Eli-Jensen-Org), giving them access to view private repos containing my completed Georgia Tech school work.

Do not request access if you are currently a student at Georgia Tech or plan to enroll there.
