## App for allowing self-invite to GitHub Organization

https://add-user-to-github-org.vercel.app/invite

A small app allowing prospective employers (using a passphrase which I can provide) to add themselves to my [GitHub Organization](https://github.com/Eli-Jensen-Org), giving them access to view private repos containing my completed Georgia Tech school work.

Do not request access if you are currently a student at Georgia Tech or plan to enroll there.
